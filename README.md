**iOS Technical Challenge**

For this test, you will use the REST services of this API: https://api.thecatapi.com

The first screen should have a voting style by race, with a like button and a dislike 
button below the image of the respective race. The result should be saved on the device 
in the way that the programmer want, to then show the saved records with date, name and 
voting type (Like, Dislike).

Create a screen with the list of cats and that when tapped this would redirect to an 
internal detail.

Apply the appropriate architecture.
